1. static array
2. dynamic arr
3. stretchable arry
4. mutable arry

1. static array: the size of array is known before to the compl
                 time.


  ex: 
  	int arr[5];


2. dy. arr:

	size of the array is allocated/known at run time.

	malloc, calloc, realloc => stdlib.h

3. stretchable array:
     size of the array are increased or dec depending on the need
     for dy. array

     malloc, calloc, realloc

4. mutable:
    the size of the array is known or allocted at the time of linking and before execution
